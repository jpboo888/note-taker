# Note Taker App

This app was made as a note taking application so that when you open it, user is presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.  When you click on the notes page, user is presented with existing notes listed, plus empty fields to enter new notes.  When user clicks on the Save icon, the note is saved and appears with the other existing notes.
